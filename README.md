[Tinker-FFE Installer for Windows](https://dasher.wustl.edu/tinker/)

The Tinker molecular modeling software is a complete and general package for molecular mechanics and dynamics, with some special features for biopolymers. Tinker has the ability to use any of several common parameter sets, such as Amber (ff94, ff96, ff98, ff99, ff99SB), CHARMM (19, 22, 22/CMAP), Allinger MM (MM2-1991 and MM3-2000), OPLS (OPLS-UA, OPLS-AA), Merck Molecular Force Field (MMFF), Liam Dang's polarizable model, AMOEBA (2004, 2009, 2013, 2017, 2018) polarizable atomic multipole force fields, AMOEBA+ that adds charge penetration effects, and our new HIPPO (Hydrogen-like Interatomic Polarizable Potential) force field.

Tinker 8 is a major new release of the Ponder Lab tool set for molecular mechanics and dynamics calculations. An important change in this new version is the switch from old-style common blocks to Fortran modules. Use of modules and greatly increased use of dynamic memory allocation means Tinker can now support very large molecular systems. Tinker 8 also implements improved OpenMP parallelization throughout many parts of the code. Additional major improvements include parallel neighbor list building and updating, a big reduction in iterations needed to converge polarization via an efficient PCG solver, and the reparameterizaton of Poisson-Boltzmann and Generalized Kirkwood implicit solvation models.

Tinker is also available on Github! The TinkerTools organization has a full Github site at [Github](https://github.com/) TinkerTools with complete source code for canonical Tinker and other packages in the Tinker software suite. The master repository on the Github site is updated frequently with new minor features and bug fixes. It the place to go for the latest revisions of the software. Prebuilt executables are not available via the Github site.

Tinker 9 is a reimplementation of significant portions of Tinker in C++, using OpenACC and CUDA to support NVIDIA GPU calculations. Tinker-HP is an distributed, MPI-parallel Fortran code that is also GPU capable via use of CUDA for compute intensive functions. Both of these Tinker-based codes are available from the TinkerTools Github site.

[PACKMOL Download](https://m3g.github.io/packmol/download.shtml)

PACKMOL creates an initial point for molecular dynamics simulations by packing molecules in defined regions of space. The packing guarantees that short range repulsive interactions do not disrupt the simulations.
The great variety of types of spatial constraints that can be attributed to the molecules, or atoms within the molecules, makes it easy to create ordered systems, such as lamellar, spherical or tubular lipid layers.
The user must provide only the coordinates of one molecule of each type, the number of molecules of each type and the spatial constraints that each type of molecule must satisfy.
The package is compatible with input files of PDB, TINKER, XYZ and MOLDY formats.

[PACKMOL](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/)

VMD is designed for modeling, visualization, and analysis of biological systems such as proteins, nucleic acids, lipid bilayer assemblies, etc. It may be used to view more general molecules, as VMD can read standard Protein Data Bank (PDB) files and display the contained structure. VMD provides a wide variety of methods for rendering and coloring a molecule: simple points and lines, CPK spheres and cylinders, licorice bonds, backbone tubes and ribbons, cartoon drawings, and others. VMD can be used to animate and analyze the trajectory of a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. In particular, VMD can act as a graphical front end for an external MD program by displaying and animating a molecule undergoing simulation on a remote computer.
